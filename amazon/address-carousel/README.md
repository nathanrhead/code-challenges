# Amazon | Address Carousel

## Task

Create a carousel that displays five of n address blocks at a time with action elements on either end that, when clicked, implement a scroll left or right to display the next five addresses.

Create everything from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only.

Scale is not at issue and you have access to a function, `getAllAddresses`, which provides the addresses to you in an array.

## Constraints

This challenge is technically contstrained to 45 minutes and is to be written in a plain text editor.

## Notes

I wrote this solution on my own, but couldn't have done it without feedback from logging to the console and viewing the ongoing result in the browser. It took me about two-and-a-half hours, so nowhere near the forty minutes max you're alotted.

At least I proved to myself that I have the knowledge and know-how to do it, even if I can't yet do it in a vaccuum, i.e., without feedback on the kind of data I'm getting from, e.g., an on-click event, or as quickly as they'd like to see it.

## Big 0

- Time: O(n), n being the number of addresses in the address array.
- Space: O(n), n being the number of addresses in the address array.
