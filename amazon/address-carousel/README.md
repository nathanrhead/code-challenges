# Amazon | Address Carousel

## Task

Create a carousel that displays five of n address blocks at a time with action elements on either end that scroll left and right to the next five addresses.

Create everything from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only.

Scale is not at issue and you have access to a function, `getAllAddresses`, which provides the addresses to you in an array.
