## Notes

Written nearly without logging, to simulate a whiteboarding environment.

Change the range--the second argument--in renderAllImages to see different numbers of images rendered, which sizes change automatically. If you add photos, you have to adjust the number of photos to match, the second argument sent to the getImageUrls function.

To run, open index.html in your browser.
