// Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

// This is the author's solution, which I skipped to because it's 4:30 in the birdsong morning.
