# Hacker Rank 30 Days of Code Challenges: Day 6: Review: Strings + Loops (Easy)

## Objective

Today we will expand our knowledge of strings, combining it with what we have already learned about loops.

## Task

Given a string, *S*, of length *N* that is indexed from 0 to *N - 1*, print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as two space-separated strings on a single line (see the sample below for more detail).

Note: 0 is considered to be an even index.

### Example

*s = adbecf*

Print *abc def*

### Input

The first line contains an integer, *T* (the number of test cases).
Each line *i* of the *T* subsequent lines contains a string, *S*.

### Constraints

1 <= *T* <= 10
2 <= length of *S* <= 10,000

### Output

For each String *S* (where 0 <= *j* <= *T - 1*), print *S*'s even-indexed characters, followed by a space, followed by *S*'s odd-indexed characters.
