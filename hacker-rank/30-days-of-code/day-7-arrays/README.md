# Hacker Rank 30 Days of Code Challenges: Day 7: Review: Arrays (Easy)

## Objective

Today, we will learn about the Array data structure.

## Task

Given an array, *A*, of *N* integers, print *A*'s elements in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

### Example

`A = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
Print *4 3 2 1*, separating each integer by one space.

### Constraints

1 <= *N* <= 1000
1 <= `*A*[i]` <= 10,000, where `*A*[i]` is the *i-th* integer in the array.
