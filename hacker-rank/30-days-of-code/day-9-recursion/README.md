# Hacker Rank 30 Days of Code Challenges: Day 9: Recursion (Easy)

## Task

Complete the factorial function in the editor. Be sure to use recursion.

The factorial has the following paramter: int n: an integer.

### Input Format

A single integer, *n* (the argument to pass to factorial).

### Constraints

2 <= n <= 12

### Sample Input

3

### Sample Output

6

### Explanation

Consider the following steps. After the recursive calls from step 1 to 3, results are accumulated from step 3 to 1.

1. factorial(3) = 3 x factorial(2) = 3 x 2 = 6
2. factorial(2) = 2 x factorial(1) = 2 x 1 = 2
3. factorial(1) = 1
