# Hacker Rank 30 Days of Code Challenges: Day 10: Binary Numbers (Easy)

## Task

Convert a base-10 integer, *n*, to binary (base-2), then find and print the base-10 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1's in *n*'s binary representation. When working with different bases, it is common to show the base as a subscript.

### Example

n = 125

The binary representation of 125 is 1111101. In base 10, there are 5 and 1 consecutive ones in two groups. Print the maximum, 5.

### Input Format

A single integer, *n*.

### Output Format

Print a single base-10 integer that denotes the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the binary representation of *n*.

### Sample Input

13

### Sample Output

2 (binary of 5 is 1101, so 2 is the largest set of consecutive 1s)
